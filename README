Steps for setting up Netbeans:
==============================
1. Install Netbeans 6.9.1 with java EE and Glassfish from (http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html)
2. Download axis2 1.5.4 from the following website (http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/download.cgi)
3. In NetBeans right click on the project translator -> Libraries -> Add JAR/Folder -> browse
you will need to add the .jar in the build folder and under axis2-1.5.4\lib select all the jar files except the log4j.jar

Set environment variables:
right click my computer -> properties -> advanced -> environment variables -> create two user variable
JAVA_HOME:"the directory where you installed java"
and AXIS2_HOME:"the directory where you installed Axis2"

To generate the stub class:
===========================
1. Open command window -> change your directory to where the wsdl2java.bat is -> write this command line:
  wsdl2java.sh -o /projects/mstranslatorapi/ -p org.diwan.soap  -ns2p org.tempuri=org.diwan.soap -or -uri http://api.microsofttranslator.com/V2/Soap.svc

wsdl2java.bat will automatically create a stub class that will call the Translate API. To see how to call the class add -t option to the
  call which will generate test code.
3. In the output folder you will get a src com.diwan.soap which will contain the stub class.
