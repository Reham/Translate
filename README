Tranaslator Web Service

Is a SOAP compliant web service that can be called to translate single lines of text to full web pages.
Code is documented use Javadoc ti generate documentation.

Steps for setting up NetBeans:
=================================
1. Install netbeans 6.9.1 with java EE and Glassfish from (http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html)
2. Download axis2 1.5.4 from the following website (http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/download.cgi)
3. Netbeans -> services tab -> expand the Servers you will find GlassFish Server -> right click on it 
    - Start the Server
    - select view admin console. 
    This will open a browser window. Select the applications folder in the list on the left 
        -> press 'Deploy' -> click browse -> find axis2.war in the 'release' directory of this project
4. In netbeans open tools -> plugins search for Axis2 under the 'Available' tab -> check it -> install it
5. Restart netbeans then go to tools -> options -> axis2 tab. Set two things:
   a. The location of the axis2 files in glassfish:
      to find this location you can go to glassfish admin console -> in the Enterprise Server option 
	  you should see: "Configuration directory". Copy that directory but instead of the "config" folder 
	  put "applications/axis2" and paste it in the "location" box.
   b. The web address url that will be there already.
6. Now you have Axis2 under the translator project -> right click -> deploy. Then right click -> show 
service in browser.

The translator service is now deployed in Netbeans.

How to use Axis2 to build a client:
===================================
1. Set environment variables:
right click my computer -> properties -> advanced -> environment variables -> create two user variable
JAVA_HOME:"the directory where you installed java" 
and AXIS2_HOME:"the directory where you installed Axis2"
2. Open command window -> change your directory to where the wsdl2java.bat is ->
write this command line 
  wsdl2java.bat -o C:\\your output folder -p org.diwan -ns2p org.tempuri=org.diwan -s -or -uri http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/Translate?wsdl
  You get this url by right click on the axis2 under your translator project in NetBeans -> select Show service in Browser
  wsdl2java.bat will automatically create a stub class that will call the Translate API. To see how to call the class add -t option to the
  call which will generate test code.
3. In the output folder you will get a build.xml file with folder
4. Go through: (http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html) to install ant 
5. In the command window change your directory to be in your output folder -> type ant 
If the build succeeded you will have in the build folder a new .jar file 
6. In NetBeans right click on the project translator -> Libraries -> Add JAR/Folder -> browse
you will need to add the .jar in the build folder and under axis2-1.5.4\lib select all the jar files except the log4j.jar 

How to use Netbeans to build a client:
======================================

1. Go to Services window - >Web Services Tab. Right click and select Add Web Service
2. Enter the URL to the Translate WDSL e.g. http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/Translate?wsdl
3. A new entry called Translate will be added.
4. Expand this to see the commands. These can be dragged and dropped into your own code and Netbeans automatically creates the bindings.
